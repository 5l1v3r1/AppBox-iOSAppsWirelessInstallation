  in AppBox**, and instead to refer to [developer](mailto:vineetchoudhary@live.in) directly
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/vineetchoudhary/AppBox-iOSAppsWirelessInstallation/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/vineetchoudhary/AppBox-iOSAppsWirelessInstallation/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
* If possible, use the bug report template to create the issue. Simply make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and **paste the content into the issue description**.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
